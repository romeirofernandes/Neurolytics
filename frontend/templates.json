In this computerized task, participants are presented with a series of virtual balloons that they can inflate by pressing a button.\n\nEach pump temporarily inflates the balloon and adds money to a temporary bank. At any point, participants can stop pumping and collect their earnings, transferring money from the temporary to the permanent bank. However, each balloon has an explosion point - if participants pump too much, the balloon explodes and they lose all money in the temporary bank for that trial.\n\n**Why BART is Important:**\nThe BART has excellent ecological validity and correlates with real-world risk behaviors including substance use, gambling, unsafe sexual practices, and delinquency. Unlike traditional questionnaire measures of risk-taking, BART involves actual behavior with tangible consequences, making it a superior predictor of real-world risk behaviors.\n\n**Clinical Applications:**\n- Addiction research and treatment evaluation\n- Impulse control disorder assessment\n- Adolescent risk behavior prediction\n- Decision-making in psychiatric populations\n\n**Key Metrics:**\n- Average pumps per balloon (risk-taking propensity)\n- Total money earned (risk-reward optimization)\n- Explosion frequency (risk calibration)\n- Pump variability (consistency of risk strategy)",

Participants must respond to a central target stimulus while ignoring surrounding 'flanker' stimuli that can be either compatible or incompatible with the target.\n\nIn a typical trial, participants see a row of letters (e.g., HHHHH or SSHSS) and must respond only to the central letter. When flankers are compatible (same as target), responses are fast and accurate. When flankers are incompatible (different from target), responses slow down and errors increase - this is the flanker effect.\n\n**Cognitive Mechanisms:**\nThe flanker task isolates the ability to focus attention on relevant information while filtering out irrelevant distractors. It measures both spatial attention (focusing on the center) and response conflict resolution (when flankers activate competing responses).\n\n**Research Applications:**\n- Developmental studies of attention (children to elderly)\n- Clinical assessment of attention deficits\n- Neuroimaging studies of cognitive control networks\n- Individual differences in distractibility\n- Effects of training and expertise\n\n**What Makes It Powerful:**\n- Simple, easy to understand and perform\n- Robust effect that replicates consistently\n- Suitable for all age groups\n- Sensitive to individual and group differences\n- Well-understood neural substrates (ACC activation)",

This elegant experiment reveals the cognitive processes involved in shifting attention, whether overtly (moving eyes) or covertly (without eye movements).\n\n**How It Works:**\nParticipants fixate on a central point while peripheral boxes appear on the left and right. One box briefly brightens (the cue), then a target appears in either the cued location (valid trial) or the opposite location (invalid trial). Participants must detect and respond to the target as quickly as possible.\n\n**The Key Finding:**\nResponses are faster when the target appears at the cued location (valid trials) compared to the uncued location (invalid trials), even though the cue doesn't predict target location. This demonstrates that attention can be shifted to a location before any eye movement occurs.\n\n**Three Components of Attention:**\nPosner identified three separable attention networks:\n1. **Alerting**: Achieving and maintaining a state of readiness\n2. **Orienting**: Selecting information from sensory input\n3. **Executive Control**: Resolving conflict among responses\n\n**Clinical Importance:**\n- Early detection of attention deficits\n- Assessment of brain injury effects\n- Understanding developmental disorders (ADHD, autism)\n- Tracking cognitive aging and dementia progression\n- Measuring rehabilitation effectiveness",

    "detailedDescription": "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem-solving task that has been used in psychological research for over a century. Invented by French mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883, it provides a pure measure of planning ability, working memory, and strategic thinking.\n\n**The Challenge:**\nParticipants must move a stack of discs from one peg to another, following two simple rules:\n1. Move only one disc at a time\n2. Never place a larger disc on top of a smaller disc\n\nWith 3 discs, the optimal solution requires 7 moves (2³-1). With 4 discs, 15 moves. The complexity grows exponentially.\n\n**Cognitive Processes Involved:**\n- **Planning**: Thinking ahead multiple moves\n- **Working Memory**: Keeping track of disc positions and goals\n- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking the problem into subgoals\n- **Hierarchical Thinking**: Understanding nested goal structures\n- **Mental Simulation**: Imagining consequences of actions\n\n**Why It's Powerful:**\nThe Tower of Hanoi is a perfect isomorph of many real-world planning problems. Success requires:\n- Understanding recursive structure\n- Resisting impulsive moves toward the goal\n- Recognizing that sometimes you must move away from the goal to eventually achieve it\n\n**Clinical Applications:**\n- Assessment of executive dysfunction\n- Frontal lobe damage evaluation\n- Tracking cognitive development in children\n- Monitoring cognitive decline in dementia\n- Measuring effects of cognitive training\n\n**Individual Differences:**\n- Age: Performance improves through childhood, peaks in young adulthood\n- Education: Correlates with years of schooling\n- Experience: Practice effects are substantial\n- Strategy: Some use perceptual strategy, others recursive algorithm",
